What have you done since the last meeting?
Devika: Created and conducted use cases and acceptance testing for the search input box to ensure search terms provide relevant results from movie API.
Adit: Worked on SQL schema and design connecting with user database and movieDB.
Hiro: Worked on experimenting with home page and react.  Made sure that text box only accepts numbers and that the min is 1 and max is 10
Oscar: I have begun working on setting up encrypted user database and familiarizing myself with the hashing library
Akanksha: Set up some dummy front end hover functionality and a pop up overlay window.

What do you plan to do for the next meeting?
Devika: Start perfecting the front end and UI of the search page to make it more aesthetic and easier for users to interact with. Create the functionality of Boolean search parameters.
Adit: Finalize SQL schema and produce use cases. Attempt to layout front end and try for acceptance testing with basic implementation.
Hiro: Continue working on the front, make sure that I can earn at least 5 points
Oscar: I plan on having completed the set up of an encrypted user database
Akanksha: I plan to have semi functional hover buttons that reflect requirements and have the pop up overlay window actually display details.

Anything blocking your progress?
Devika: Outside commitments from other classes are making it difficult to manage my time and complete as much as I need to within the time I have available. 
Adit: There is a learning curve to JavaScript and React, but I am getting through it.
Hiro: The deadline for the first sprint is coming up so it is stressful 
Oscar: Commitments from other classes and work
Akanksha: Workload from other classes is limiting the time I can dedicate to learning React
