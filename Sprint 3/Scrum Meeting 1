What have you done since the last meeting? 

Akanksha: Been trying to restandardize movie details to only show 10 results for all filters
Oscar: Worked on create account page and modifying UI across the app.
Adit: I have added more functionality to the adding/saving watchlists with starting the “+”, “I”, and “$” buttons. I have implemented the hover feature on the buttons and gotten it to work with each movie.
Devika: Begun working on search button and enter button to submit a search
Hiroaki: Worked on suggesting movies and pulling from API to suggest

What do you plan to do for the next meeting? 

Akanksha: I hope to have ensured only 10 results are ever shown
Oscar: Complete UI changes and complete create account requirements
Adit: I am working on connecting the front-end watchlist to the schema with JSON.
Devika: I plan to have the search button functionality finished
Hiroaki: Connecting the movie suggestions to a watchlist format

Anything blocking your progress?

Akanksha: I am working towards understanding how to limit the number of results shown
Oscar: Struggling to understand how to include external UI kits
Adit: I am having trouble understanding how to construct the schema and use the API.
Devika: No blocks
Hiroaki: No blocks
