For this sprint, we will be fine-tweaking the basic implementation of the pages we have been working on the past two sprints. We will aim to complete the saving/creating watchlists functionality as well as ensure we meet requirements for viewing movie details, search, and generating suggestions. We have added encryption details, CSS requirements, and montages to our sprint.
