For this sprint, we are attempting to finish the watchlist functionality by tomorrow (4/18). We have added UI to all of our mostly complete features and will continue to add as features finish. Once the watchlist functionality is complete, we will be able to connect the Adding to Watchlist through Search feature. Then, we will be able to link users as a foreign key to the watchlist DB. Since many features are dependent on the watchlist functionality, we have prioritized that.
