What do you plan to do for the next meeting? 

Akanksha: I will work on integrating photo montage with the backend of watchlists, and fixing bugs in Movie Details.
Oscar: I plan to finalize the front end of watchlists.
Adit: I will work on the JUnit, Jest, and Acceptance tests for watchlists
Devika: Will work on fixing bugs between search results and seeing movie details and moving API calls to backend instead of front end. 
Hiroaki: Finish off the rest of suggestion acceptance tests and jtest 

Anything blocking your progress?

Akanksha: API calls are very inconsistent and difficult to debug.
Oscar: Authentication tokens.
Adit: I’m having some trouble with mocking the database connection.
Devika: The API is very finicky and inconsistent with what information it provides for each movie - information for search results are missing sometimes which leads to poor UI.
Hiroaki: Some trouble in changing the jtest.
